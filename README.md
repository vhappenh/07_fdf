# fdf

"FDF" is a computer graphics project focusing on representing a landscape as a 3D wireframe model. 
The project introduces students to basic graphics programming using the MiniLibX library. 
The main objectives include learning how to create images, handle keyboard and mouse events, and manipulate points in space to create a wireframe representation of landscapes. 
The project follows common instructions such as adherence to the Norm, proper memory management, and Makefile requirements.
